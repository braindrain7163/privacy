Alternatives to surveillance services (Google, Microsoft and etc):

ClearNet: https://privacyguides.org/

I2P: http://privacyguides.i2p/?i2paddresshelper=fvbkmooriuqgssrjvbxu7nrwms5zyhf34r3uuppoakwwsm7ysv6q.b32.i2p

TOR:  http://www.xoe4vn5uwdztif6goazfbmogh6wh5jc4up35bqdflu6bkdc5cas5vjqd.onion/

-> If you use Tor browser, please:

Disable Javascript.

Use the Safer or Safest mode in Tor.

Use bridges (I recommend SnowFlake, consider host your SnowFlake: https://support.torproject.org/en/censorship/how-to-help-running-snowflake/).

You should never install any additional extensions on Tor Browser or edit  about:config settings, including the ones we suggest for Firefox. Browser extensions and non-standard settings make you stand out from others on the Tor network, thus making your browser easier to fingerprint.

Use only HTTPS websites if the website don't have a .onion version.

Change circuits every time you change the website/service, Tor make this every 3 minutes.

Don't download or open documents in Tor Browser.

I recommend (optional) you use Tor + VPN (why? If you use Tor + VPN you have best censorship protection and best protection against spy nodes in Tor).

VPNs don't provide anonimity, I recommend TOR and I2P.

do NOT use VPN server as Tor Exit Node.

If you need VPNs (like use with Tor):

Mullvad (accept XMR + Wireguard + MultiHop).

IVPN (accept XMR + Wireguard + MultiHop).

AirVPN (accept XMR + Wireguard + Port forward).

Configuration:

• Enable the kill switch to block all traffic if the VPN disconnects.

• Configure a firewall to restrict all traffic outside the VPN tunnel.

• Enable auto-start on boot and make sure your VPN is connected before launching apps or browsers.

• Disable IPv6 and WebRTC to prevent potential leaks.

• Use provider’s DNS servers or custom encrypted DNS (e.g., NextDNS, DNSCrypt) see in PrivacyGuides.

• Use DNSSEC.

• have QNAME Minimization.

• Have ECS disabled or anonymized.

• For extra privacy, use multihop VPN or bridge relays if available.

-> Best practices for VPN:

• Rotate between servers when switching between tasks to minimize correlation and tracking.

• Do not log into personal accounts (email, social media, bank, etc.) while using the same privacy-focused VPN session. This links your real identity to the VPN IP. Use separate devices, browsers profiles and VPN sessions for personal work.

For search: Use SearXNG, is decentralized and you can self-host your instance. SearXNG instances: https://searx.space/

Browsers: -> In my opinion all browsers are useless for privacy, I recommend you use QubesOS for compartimentalization with SearXNG with your own instance or public instances (https://searx.space/) to solve this. (I recommend use your own instance of SearXNG and use with .onion) Why I think all browsers are useless for privacy: https://simplifiedprivacy.com/web-browsers-become-the-new-os/and-the-program-is-tyranny.html

-> The best browsers (use one for at activity - I2P isn't here because I2P only works in I2P network):

Mullvad Browser.

Tor Browser (or Onion Browser in IOS).

Brave (see below).

LibreWolf.

See more (important):

https://www.privacyguides.org/en/tor/#tor-browser

Use I2P to make torrent. -> https://std.rocks/p2p_i2p_torrent.html

Alternative to centralized social networks: Nostr (USE WITH TOR VIA ORBOT), Mintra (USE WITH I2P OR TOR), Bastyon (Russian NOSTR, USE WITH TOR GOOD AGAINST CENSORSHIP), Mastodon and Lemmy (USE WITH TOR).

WARNING: verify all OpenPGP keys, DON'T TRUST IN ANYONE, use pseudo-anonymous names (a diferent username for all accounts, a diferent username for all account, NEVER just don't reuse usernames, don't have a tractable pattern to your usernames.), and don't open untrusted archives, AND NEVER GIVE YOUR PERSONAL DATA/INFO.

Darknet Market Maximalism: https://antimoonboy.com/darknetmarketmaximalism/ \\\\\\\\

https://simplifiedprivacy.com/which-freedom-tech/is-better-at-what.html

Cloud: Use TrueNAS/XigmaNAS + I2P/TOR + Kyun server (pay with Monero) + encrypt with OpenPGP to send to cloud -> https://www.sambent.com/truenas-monero-tor-i2p-darknet-privacy-upgrade-100-free/

E-mail: Use Thunderbird (client) + OpenPGP (use GnuPG or see https://simplifiedprivacy.com/self-host-pgp-emails-to-protonmail/without-using-proton.html - Use EAS-256 + ECC curves) + Anonaddy or SimpleLogin has alias (or self-host a e-mail alias) + Tor (or Orbot) or I2P (https://eyedeekay.github.io/Thunderbird-I2P-Configuration/index.html) Self-host a e-mail or a alias: https://stalw.art/

When generating keys I suggest using the future-default command as this will instruct GnuPG use modern cryptography such as Curve25519 and Ed25519:

gpg --quick-gen-key alice@example.com future-default

Messagers: SimpleX.chat, XMPP, Cwtch, Session (social media - https://simplifiedprivacy.com/session-v-nostr/) and Molly.im are the bests (install Molly via Fdroid, Molly is compatible with Signal, is a Signal fork but is 100% FOSS).

Configuration:

• Disable displaying your phone number (in Molly), use the Molly 100% FOSS version (https://molly.im/fdroid.html - Molly has 3 versions) Warning: If you use Molly you are trusting in 2 dev team(s).

• Enable automatic chat deletion (after 24h or after X day for example).

• Enable passcode/password protection.

• Disable lock screen notifications in mobile phone settings.

-> How config XMPP for max privacy and security

• https://simplifiedprivacy.com/xmpp-decentralized-signal-get-your-own-social-network/ • https://simplifiedprivacy.com/trump-signal/why-xmpp-is-better.html • Use OMEMO with OpenPGP. • Use TOR/I2P with your own XMPP server.

-> Best practices:

• Manually delete chats for all participants after exchanging sensitive info.

• Use OpenPGP encryption to ensure your messages are fully protected and verifiably signed.

To OS (Computer/laptop): QubesOS (use with Whonix), KickSecure, SecureBlue (Fedora-based) or TailsOS.

Tails best pratices: https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/tails-best/

A Anarchist guide to Internet anonimity:

https://www.anarsec.guide/

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Kicksecure

When to Use Whonix: For tasks that require guaranteed Tor routing and anonymity.

-> Whonix is good to protection against fingerprinting, I recommend so much use with QubesOS.

When to Use Kicksecure: For applications needing security hardening without anonymity.

To OS (Smartphone): GrapheneOS with Pixel phone.

https://grapheneos.org/

https://grapheneos.org/faq

https://grapheneos.org/install/

DON'T install via WebUSB

-> Protection against ISP censorship:

Freifunk (mesh network).

Use OpenWRT or LibreCMC (libreCMC is an FSF-endorsed derivation of OpenWrt with the proprietary blobs removed. If your device is supported by libreCMC, definitely use it over OpenWrt.), OPNsense (private alternative to Pfsense) is good too.

Use WPA3.

https://www.torbox.ch/

The best anti-malware:

Good sense ;)

USE OPENPGP.

OpenPGP tools:

GnuPG.

EmailSelf-Defense.

GPG tools.

GPG4Win.

Kleopatra.

Tutorial: https://odysee.com/@anti_moonboy:7/pgptutorial:4

-> Physical Surveillance

Agents first monitor your address, then attempt to follow you discreetly using vehicles or on foot.

How to evade:

• Plan a long and confusing route. Periodically but discreetly check if you’re being followed.

• Avoid using the same route to prevent predictability.

• Watch for recurring people or vehicles – seeing the same person/car in three different locations is a red flag. Memorize the face/car and proceed with increased awareness.

• Take short breaks to observe and analyze your surroundings.

• Dress neutrally and suitably for the environment. Avoid bright clothing and regularly change your appearance.

• Act like a normal person – avoid unusual behavior, don’t stare, and stay calm.

• Don’t forget that agents can track your GPS location via your mobile device.

And use Monero (XMR) to finantial privacy.

How use Monero: https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/

"But Monero can have a inflation bug" -> https://www.moneroinflation.com/

Other tools: -> https://moneroconsensus.info/ -> https://gupax.io/guide/ -> https://monero.garden/

P.S. -> Use Monero (XMR) with your OWN NODE AND OPEN THE 18081 PORT + USE YOUR NODE VIA TOR/I2P, and use Wallets like Anonero, Feather Wallet, GUI/CLI oficial wallets (in https://getmonero.org). Buy Monero via RetoSwap.com, OpenMonero.com (CEX - P2P), Eigenwallet.org, BasicSwapDEX or Serai.exchange (coming soon). Make Monero mining via P2Pool (or P2Pool mini) and use Gupaxx.

WARNING Don't make this with Monero:

DON'T USE A REMOTE NODE (use your OWN NODE via TOR/I2P to max privacy)

DON'T USE KYC - CEX (Use the recomended DEX like RetoSwap.com, OpenMonero.com (CEX - P2P), Eigenwallet.org and BasicSwapDEX, I recommend use Trocador.app or Cyphergoat.com has agregator).

NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS, AND USE ONE-TIME ADRESSES FOREVER (STEALTH ADRESS), DON'T RE-USE ADRESS.

Verify Monero binaries: https://docs.getmonero.org/interacting/verify-monero-binaries/

NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS, have SELF-CUSTODY of your keys, have air-gapped encrypted wallets with MULTISIGS (use Veracrypt for plausible deniability).

DON'T USE MYMONERO, they have some Red flags (and can see your view key).

The recomended wallets are (all fully are open-source):

-> Hot wallets:

Feather Wallet.

GUI/CLI oficial wallets (in https://getmonero.org).

Monero.com (by CakeWallet).

Monerujo (disable PocketChange).

MonFluo.

Eigenwallet.org

-> Cold wallets:

Stell wallet (fully off-line, but don't have encryption or password).

Paper wallet (fully off-line, but don't have encryption or password).

Brain wallet (your brain, you have a good memory?).

Anonero.io

CupCake.

SideKick (by Monerujo, disable PocketChange).

-> Hardware wallets:

Trezor (Reccomended).

Keystone.

Why not Ledger?

Ledger isn't 100% Open-source.

Ledger leaked client data (https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Ledger).

"Ledger recovery", Ledger can have your seed.

-> OTHER:

Make Monero mining via Solo mining, P2Pool or P2Pool mini (use Gupaxx).

Buy and sell things for Monero in XMRBaazar (and NeroShop in future).

Consider all other wallets and CEXs not mentioned here as SCAM.

Any seed typed on the keyboard of any device should be considered possibly compromised.

Legal side:

Shut up and don't say anything without a lawyer.

Don't say anything if they ask about something, anything can be used against you.

Don't let any authority enter your property without a valid judicial warrant, and it's essential that you use strong passwords with an encrypted hard drive (restart your phone/laptop if they try to take it from you).

-> The best thing(s) you can buy for Physical security:

BusKill (https://www.buskill.in/).

Upscreen privacy shield (https://upscreen.com/solutions/privacy/).
